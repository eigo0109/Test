// This is a NSURLProtocol to handle URLs of the type http://.RESOURCE./
// These point into the package's resource directory. Files that interact with
// Flash v8+ cannot appear to come from the localhost or else Flash will refuse
// to let them interact with the network. This protocol works around that by
// making local files seem to come from the network.
